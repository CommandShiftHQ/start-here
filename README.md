ðŸŽ¬ # Start Here, a boilerplate repo

This repository is a boilerplate that can be used as a start to a `Node.js` project without having to worry about tooling.

## Instructions

1 - Fork this repository and clone down your fork.

2 - Change into the cloned folder.

3 - Run `npm install` to install the necessary libraries required for `Node.js` to run.

4 - There are two folders: `/main` and `/spec` which contain `index.js` and `index.spec.js` respectively.  

5 - Write your test(s) in `index.spec.js` or add more test files to `spec`.

6 - Write your code on `index.js` or add more files and/or folders to `main`.

7 - Don't forget to update this README with details of your work.

8 - Commit your work when you have written an implementation that passes a test.

9 - Push your work. Before pushing tests, test coverage, linting and code formatting will be checked. Only code that is well formated with passing tests and 100% code coverage can be pushed.

## Scripts

`npm t` or `npm run test` - runs the tests, test coverage and linter
`npm test:watch` - runs the tests in "watch" mode (tests re-run automatically when code is changed)
`npm lint` - runs the linting tool individually
